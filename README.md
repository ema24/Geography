Wooohoo. Not over yet. Obviously.

What does it do?
===============
This script takes GEOFLA data (the boundaries of French communes opendata'ed by the IGN) and takes an extremal point (eastmost, northmostâ€¦). With this point, and the population of the commune, I'm able to find the geographic median of the population.

TODO
====
 * Find data for moar countries.
 * Why has the median to be either longitudinal or latitudinal? Find the median in any direction.
 * Write blogpost to explain the question.
 * Median is the simplest form of distribution, quartiles, centiles are next. PGF ftw (dunno how to represent that however).
